## About
An application that is built to assist with Gym Exercises to perform them properly. The working of this application is based on finding the correct points 
and using these points we will get the desired angles. Then based on these angles we find many gestures including barbell curls, pushups, squats, and many others.
The core of this application is powered by the [MediaPipe](https://google.github.io/mediapipe/) framework. This application is developed using the [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) library and 
programmed in Python.

The biggest advantage of this application is that it doesnâ€™t necessarily need a [GPU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit) to work in real-time, because it can work seamlessly in real - time using by only using the CPU computation.

## Motivation
Many people who are exercising lack professional guidance. They tend to miss out on a lot of potential gains either by performing the exercise incorrectly or by having poor posture while doing it. In some cases, they may even end up doing more harm than good.

This application aims to help in that regard by helping and guiding when performing a variety of exercises. This application helps people in maintaining the right posture while performing exercises.
